## Shared build and human review

Use the personal `~/.codex/skills/bmad-build/SKILL.md` inside the work selected by this repository's
dispatch/Goal workflow. Use `~/.codex/skills/bmad-build/references/qa.md` for machine-review lenses,
finding triage and repairs, together with this repository's own QA checks and completion gates.
Use `~/.codex/skills/bmad-checkpoint-preview/SKILL.md` for the human review trail; it replaces the old
repository-ownership-practice checks. Ordinary delivery uses build-handoff mode; explicit checkpoint
or `--practice` requests use interactive review. The shared skills own only this personal workflow;
project authority, semantic approvals, execution permissions and work records remain locally governed.
